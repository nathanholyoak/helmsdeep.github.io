It has been an eventful beginning to 2011. In recent weeks have seen one disaster after another, affecting large parts of Australia. The sheer force of nature is both fearsome and awe-inspiring.

Nature teaches us about God, "Ever since the creation of the world Godâ€™s eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen from what has been made" ([Rom. 1:20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom. 1:20)). These events have given us a lesson in how powerful God is, and how small we are, how powerless.

Technology often disguises this fact. We build bigger dams, stronger houses. They will save us next time. Doctors can heal us, our learning will guide us, electric lights will dispel the darkness. These things all give us the false sense that we are in control. But, "can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?" ([Matt. 6:27](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt. 6:27)). In the face of God and His vast creation we are tiny and insignificant. Dearly loved, but helpless.

Understanding this is the beginning of humility. It is also the beginning of wisdom ([Prov. 9:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Prov. 9:10)).

While our minds struggle to comprehend the whys and wherefores of these disasters, we are reminded that all we can do is kneel humbly before God and say, "Here I am, I have come to do your will, my God." ([Heb. 10:7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb. 10:7)).
