God is not distant, He is not aloof. His rightful place is in heaven yet the Bible is all about God coming to earth, becoming involved with people, engaging with them.

God did not just mechanically give Isaiah a message to pass on. God wanted to reason with him, to share with him so that he would understand this wonderful news of God's forgiveness.

God also wanted to share with Abraham about the wickedness of Sodom.

> Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him. For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just.

Abraham then debates with God over what He should do. Can you imagine doing that? But Abraham does not argue selfishly; he reminds God about who He is and what is important. <cite>"Far be it from you to do such a thing â€” to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?"</cite> If God will not act rightly, who will?

God did not forget what was right, He wanted Abraham to understand what was right so that he could lead his family righteously. God taught him by engaging with him.

That is also why Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us -- to become involved with us and teach us the way. Let's join in and walk with Him. What a wonderful God! Who, O God is like you?
